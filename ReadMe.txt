Hello!


Feel free to use this code in your projects. You can give me credit or not, it doesn't matter. =)

This is really handy when you have a program where you want the client to have the ability to customize the application at runtime.

If you liked this code and thought it was useful, please vote. If you didn't like it, e-mail me at a_shimoon@hotmail.com and tell me why,
so I can update it in upcoming versions.




Current version: 0.2

I added some code to 0.2 so that each time the user unloads the app, the customized interface is saved to the registry. Then, when 
they open it again, their customized interface will be restored.
